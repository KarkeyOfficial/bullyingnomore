      <h1>What is Bullying?</h1>
      <p>Bullying is an ongoing, aggressive behavior that is used to intimidate or oppress a victim which involves a power imbalance. The behavior is repeated, or has the potential to be repeated, over time.</p>
      <h2>Types of Bullying</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Physical Bullying</h3>
          <p>Hurting a person's body or possessions. Examples include hitting, kicking, pushing, shoving, spitting, tripping, and taking or breaking someone's things. This type of bullying is often the most visible, but it's not the only type.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Verbal Bullying</h3>
          <p>Saying or writing mean things. Verbal bullying includes teasing, name-calling, inappropriate sexual comments, taunting, and threatening to cause harm.  It can leave lasting emotional scars.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Social Bullying</h3>
          <p>Sometimes called relational bullying, this involves hurting someone's reputation or relationships. It includes leaving someone out on purpose, telling other children not to be friends with someone, spreading rumors, and embarrassing someone in public. This can be very subtle and insidious.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Cyberbullying</h3>
          <p>Any form of bullying that occurs online or via a mobile device. It can be verbal or written, and can include threats of violence as well as images, videos, and/or audio.  It can happen anytime, anywhere, and can reach a wide audience.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Mental Bullying</h3>
          <p>Mental bullying is the use of words to isolate, mock, or tease another individual. Emotional bullying targets an individual's emotions, confidence, and self-worth.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Emotional Bullying</h3>
          <p>Emotional Bullying includes non-physical behaviors that are meant to control, isolate, or frighten you. This may present in romantic relationships as threats, insults, constant monitoring, excessive jealousy, manipulation, humiliation and intimidation. </p>

          <h3> Spritual Bullying</h3>
