      <h1>Lets all be an Upstanders</h1>
      <p>Bullying is a serious issue that can have long lasting effects on individuals and communities. It is important to take action to prevent and address bullying behavior. One way to do this is by being an upstander.</p>
      <h2>Who are Upstanders? </h2>
      <p>Upstanders are individuals who take action to support those who are being bullied. They stand up for what is right and do not stand by silently while others are being mistreated. Upstanders can be anyone, including friends, family members, teachers, and community members. They are people who see bullying and chooses to do something to stop it or help the victim. They don't just stand by and watch, they stand up for what's right.</p>
      <h2>Importance of an Upstander</h2>
     <ul>
      <li> <strong>You can stop the abuse: </strong>It only takes one person to intervene and make a difference. Bullies usually shy away when someone acknowledges what's going on, especially if that someone is their classmate.</li>
      <li> <strong>You help the victim feel empowered: </strong> An individual being bullied will feel an enormous sense of relief knowing someone else is looking out for them. It gives them numerical strength.</li>
      <li> <strong>You create a culture of a safer school: </strong>When everyone intervenes and becomes an upstander (instead of a bystander), it fosters an environment that creates a culture that says bullying is unacceptable at our school. When everyone feels safe, everyone succeeds.</li>
      <li> <strong>You take the moral high ground:</strong> Anyone who chooses to be an upstander does so with compassion, bravery, and respect. You improve the quality of life for everyone in the community.</li>
     </ul>
      
     <h2>What can an Upstander Do?</h2>
      <p>Here are some ways you can be an upstander:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sticking up for others:</strong> If you hear someone making a bullying comment, you say something yourself and call them out for their inappropriate behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>Helping the victim:</strong> Let the person know you're there for them and can help them through this horrible experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Reporting bullying: </strong>Sometimes, bullying happens when no one's around; if you see it and can make a difference, speak to a trusted adult who can.</li>
        <li> <strong>Being a friend: </strong>No one should feel alone. Encourage those you think are being bullied or lonely to join you in activities so they're not so isolated.</li>
        <li><strong>Raising awareness:</strong> Sometimes people don't even know they're being bullies; offer information to your peers regarding the effects of bullying.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By taking these actions, you can help create a safer and more supportive environment for everyone. Remember, being an upstander is not just about standing up for others, but also about promoting kindness and respect in your community.</p>
