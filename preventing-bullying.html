      <h1>Preventing Bullying at OPAC</h1>
      <p>Establishing a bully-free environment is a community responsibility. Bullying must not only be avoided in school, but the students, staff, parents, and OPAC community let it be known that together, they will work to stop it. The following methods will help ensure a bully-free atmosphere:</p>
      <h2>Prevention Strategies</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Promoting Positive School Culture:</strong>A positive environment and inclusion are some of the best preventative measures. Programs that foster group effort, conflict resolution, and positive social interaction are integral. Where respect, sociability, and attentiveness reign, it's less likely that a bullying-type atmosphere will reign instead; for one to succumb to such behaviours would be to go against the greater culture.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clear Reporting and Support Systems:</strong> Let the school community know that everyone should assist. Have safe zones where students/staff can voice their opinions without fear of retribution. Printed materials honouring the kind act of the week encourage such viewpointsâ€”the more students and even teachers and parents engage in ongoing appreciation efforts and discussions, the more inclusive impact is felt and the less likely bullying behaviours will persist.
          <br><br>

         <ul><li>Designated "Safe Adults": Clear identification of teachers, counsellors, etc., who serve as champions for the anti-bullying policy. This could be a poster campaign around the school with their pictures/names/roles.</li>

          <li>Follow-Up and Support: There should be a clear protocol for follow-up to assess incidents and provide support for those being bullied and counselling sessions for bullies to understand how their behaviours can change. The fact that there is follow-up reminds students that reporting was not in vain.</li></ul>
        </li>
        </ol>
      <p>With such methods preventing bullying in our classrooms and on the playground, we can make OPAC a safe and reputable place for all. A culture of respect, compassion, and inclusion through OPAC provides students quick and safe access to report occurrences with the understanding that their messages will be taken seriously. By working together, we can make OPAC a place where everyone feels safe and respected through the following methods to prevent bullying in our classrooms and playgrounds.</p>
